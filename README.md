This is a billing software, where admin can upload and update items to the database through XLS sheet & customer can see the products list from the database, choose products and order them. Email jar is also used to send emails to the user .
Initially we created a database with one table UserRecord and inserted one record into it with userid=admin and password=admin.
When the user login using these details to the software, there appears a form which allows the user to set its customized details like userid, password,etc.The record is inserted to the table and now login can further login to the system using his userid and password.
Then the dashboard appears with 2 menu buttons, admin and customer. Admin can upload and download the products to and from the database using XLS sheet, and admin is sent mail when either of the actions takes place.
Then the customer can see the products list, choose the items as per its need and place order with final bill generated.
